It's stupid, but the way the camera thing will have to work is to make a virtual camera with pyvirtualcam that can be forwarded to Electron. But this requires OBS on Mac/Win, and a special package on Linux, which the Electron app will need to auto-install for us in its final version.
Camera and serial port are separate. Should camera autoconnect, but serial not autoconnect?

Maybe have one screen where it asks you to connect to the gimbal, and then only proceed to the main control panel once you're connected.

How should Python pick which camera to use? Should Electron tell it?
